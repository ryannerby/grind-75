# Grind 75 - Coding Interview Preparation

This repository contains solutions to the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) coding interview problems, organized by week. Each problem is solved in JavaScript and includes the problem statement and solution approach.

## 📚 Problem Structure

The problems are organized into 8 weeks, with each week containing 7-13 problems of increasing difficulty:

- **Week 01**: Basic algorithms and data structures
- **Week 02**: Arrays, strings, and linked lists
- **Week 03**: Advanced algorithms and tree traversal
- **Week 04**: Dynamic programming and graph algorithms
- **Week 05**: Binary search and advanced tree problems
- **Week 06**: Backtracking and matrix problems
- **Week 07**: Advanced algorithms and system design
- **Week 08**: Complex algorithms and optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grind-75.git
   cd grind-75
   ```

2. Each problem file contains:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution implementation
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Test cases (where applicable)
