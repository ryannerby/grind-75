/**
 * Basic Calculator
 * 
 * Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "1 + 1"
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
 * Output: 23
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * - s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
 * - s represents a valid expression.
 * - '+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
 * - '-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
 * - There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
 * - Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

// Test cases
console.log(calculate("1 + 1")); // Expected: 2
console.log(calculate(" 2-1 + 2 ")); // Expected: 3
console.log(calculate("(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)")); // Expected: 23
console.log(calculate("1")); // Expected: 1
console.log(calculate("- (3 + (4 + 5))")); // Expected: -12
console.log(calculate("2-(5-6)")); // Expected: 3
